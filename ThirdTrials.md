# Guidemy - Third Trials

### How to learn

Personally, I follow **pomodoro technique** for self-study.

The original technique has **six** steps:

1. Decide on the topic to be learned.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for **25 minutes**).
3. Study the topic - book, online course, article, etc.
4. End the study when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. If you have finished fewer than **three** pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three
   pomodoros.
6. After **three** pomodoros are done, take the **fourth** pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30
   minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

Learning programming is like learning car driving or swimming:

- learn the theory first
- then do hands-on coding as much as possible
- test the code
- refactor / improve the code

**Bottom line**: do as much hands-on coding as possible and try to BUILD something.

### How to find resources

1. **Books**: go an amazon site and search for a topic - say "Clean Code". It will list down all the best books with the
   highest ratings and customer feedbacks. Chose the best book.
2. **Online free videos**: similarly search for the topic on Google -> search for videos -> it will give the highest
   viewed videos.
3. **Paid courses**: various sites are available like **Udemy**, **Coursera**, **edX**, **Lynda**, **Pluralsight**, etc.
4. **Articles**: there are many good articles available like **Baeldung**, **Medium**, **Quora**, **GeeksForGeeks**, **
   Edureka**, etc.

Alternatively, go to **ChatGPT** and search for best resources available for learning a topic. :)

In the real job, almost all the developers use **StackOverflow** a lot.

### How to stay abreast of the latest technology trends

This is a common myth while working in a bank.

To upgrade to a new version of Java or embrace any new technology, say Kotlin - it requires cost or budget approvals.

In the banks, if a project requires efforts without bringing any significant value to the finance or trading is not
worth.

Only once a technology becomes very outdated and almost out of license (for support) - then we need to upgrade to a
newer version. Same goes with using a new technology.

Nevertheless, for personal interest - if one needs to stay abreast with the latest technology trends, we will suggest
joining events and conferences like: **YOW**, **Eventbrite**, **Java Conferences**, **Oracle and IBM conferences**, etc.
